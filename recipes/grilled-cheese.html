        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
           <ul><li>1/2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 lb. frozen chopped spinach</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and pepper</li>
            <li>4 slices bread</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella</li>
            <li>1 oz. feta</li>
            <li>1 pinch crushed red pepper</li>
            </ul>     
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the olive oil and minced garlic to a skillet. Sauté over medium heat for about one minute, then add the frozen spinach (no need to thaw), and a pinch of salt and pepper. Continue to sauté over medium until most of the moisture has evaporated from the skillet.</li>
            <li>Spread butter over one side of each of the slices of bread. Flip the bread over so the buttered side is facing down as you build the sandwiches.</li>
            <li>Divide half of the shredded mozzarella between two slices of bread. Top the mozzarella with the crumbled feta.</li>
            <li>Divide the cooked spinach between the two sandwiches, then top with the remaining shredded mozzarella and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes. Top each sandwich with the second slice of bread, buttered side facing out.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-low. Once hot, add the sandwiches and cook on each side until golden brown and crispy on the outside and warm and gooey on the inside.</li>
            <li>Cut the sandwiches in half and serve!</li>
        </ol>
